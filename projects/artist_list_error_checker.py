"""
sPython program that handles exceptions related to list operations

Modify Artist List: Write a function to replace an artist in the top_artists list. The function should ask the user for an index and a new artist name. Ensure your function catches and handles ValueError for invalid number conversion and IndexError for out-of-range indices.
General Error Handling: Modify your function to catch both ValueError and IndexError using a single except block. Provide a general error message like "An input error occurred."
