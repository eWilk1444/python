"""
Python program that prompts the user to enter a password and validates it against specific criteria

Set up your program in a main() function
Create a Python program that asks the user to input a password.
Ensure the password meets the following criteria:
Between 8 to 20 characters long.
Contains at least one uppercase letter.
Contains at least one lowercase letter.
Includes at least one number.
Includes at least one symbol from the set: !@#$%&*.
Use a while loop to keep asking for the password until all criteria are met.
Once a valid password is entered, prompt the user to enter it again for confirmation.
Use try-except blocks to handle any errors or exceptions that occur.
If the second password entry matches the first, display a success message. Otherwise, prompt the user to start the process again.
